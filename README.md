## Typescript Advance Course Practices

- Here you find code from my practice with TS advanced course

## What you will find in this project?

- Auto bundling and running: When you perform any of execution options, the current typescript file will be bundled to a `js` file in the `dist/` folder, which will be created on the first run and overwrite the previous file on the following run and also will run the `js` file in the sequence;
- Linter: **\*EsLint** has some settings to help you to avoid common errors when writing code and also will suggest good practices to follow;
- Husky: Set to run lint before a commit, others commands can be added according your necessity
- Calculator application developed by HCode and enhanced by me, it runs and open automatically, use 'Run Calculator Application' on Run and Debug menu on VS Code
- Unit tests using Jest, these tests are supposed to test the main function of the application. it also used by by pre-commit configs that prevents broken code to be commited to main branch

## Execution Options

#### Easy way

1- Hit `F5` key.

#### Command Line

2 - Run following commands on terminal:

- `npx webpack --mode development src/your_folder/your_file.ts`
- `node dist/bundle.js`.

### Prepare Your Local Repo

- Run `npm ci`

### Detailed Folder Structure and Configurations

#### Folders

- **`.husky`**

    - Pre-commit configurations, others settings can be added as well, such as pre-push and post-merge;
    - The "\_" folder store template files with proper names and extensions for each setting;
    - In order to add other setting, copy the template file to the ".husky" as done with "pre-commit" setting.

- **`.vscode`**

    - Json files with custom configurations, no need to change.

- **`dist`**

    - Folder that store the bundled typescript file.

- **`src/scripts`**
    - All scripts containing the basics of typescript, although they are all parametrized with eslint, which is configured as detailed below.

#### Files

- **`eslint.config.mjs`**

    - Main configuration file for ESLint, containing settings, rules, and plugins. You can customize this file according to your project‚Äôs linting requirements.

- **`.gitignore`**

    - Configuration file specifying files and directories to be ignored by Git. These items won‚Äôt be tracked or pushed to your repository.

- **`.prettierrc.json`**

    - Configuration file for Prettier, a code formatter. It contains formatting rules like line width, tab width, and style preferences, for this project only a basic configuration was set due ESLint rules already cover all the rest.

- **`tsconfig.json`**

    - Configuration file for TypeScript that specifies compiler options, file inclusions, and TypeScript version. It defines how the TypeScript code is compiled.

- **`webpack.config.js`**

    - Configuration file for Webpack, a module bundler. It defines how the project‚Äôs modules are compiled, bundled, and transformed.

- **`jest.config.ts`**
    - Configuration file for Jest, a testing framework. It includes settings for running tests with TypeScript, using `ts-jest` preset, and mapping module names for CSS and media files. It also specifies the test environment as `jsdom` and ignores the `dist` folder for tests.
